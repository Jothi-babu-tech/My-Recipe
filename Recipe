first in a bowl take coco powder, milk powder, Icing sugar and seive it nicely 
Use Double boiler method for doing chocolate. 
melt the butter and add the vannila essence.
and then add the mixture of milk powder, Icing sugar and coco powder spoon by spoon
stir it nicely until it gets smoothier
As much as the chocolate gets smoothier the more silkier the chocolate will be.
At this stage you either eat it as a hot chocolate or freeze it and then after 3 hour can eat it 
Thats all the chocolate recipe is over
I hope you enjoyed doing your recipe if you did
Thank You!!!
